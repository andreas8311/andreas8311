Hi and welcome!

I am a former strategy consultant and supply chain director with passion for IT, Programming, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

Some technical highlights:
 - Built a rain forecasting model by using next image prediction (see repository Meteo)
 - Built my own version of DeepMind's AlphaZero but for the game Connect4 (repository to be shared shortly)
 - Achieved Legendary status on CodinGame Bot programming (username AndreasNEO)

Thanks
